To start the app, type in "npm run dev" in the console. This will run both the server and the react development server simultaniously.

If you want to make the react server production ready, type in "npm run build". This will build the index_bundle.js file with webpack to be used by the node server.

All the back end related files are in the map called /server.
All the front end development related files are in the map called /client.
All the front end production ready files are in the map called /dist.
